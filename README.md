# Photoshop Export - Substance Painter plugin

This plugin adds an 'Export To PlotoShop' button to the main toolbar of Substance Painter. The export action creates one photoshop document for each channel of each stack of the Substance Painter document, preserving the stack hierarchy (layers and groups). Unfortunately, blending modes and filters are not fully compatible between Photoshop and Substance Painter, hence the final result can be different between the two softwares.

## Installation

Download or clone this project into the Substance Painter plugins folder. The plugins folder can be opened from Substance Painter through the menu ``Plugins/Plugins folder``. Substance Painter needs to be restarted for the plugin to take effect.
