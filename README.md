# Photoshop Export - Substance 3D Painter plugin

This plugin adds an __Export To Photoshop__ button to the Send To menu of Substance 3D Painter. The export action creates one Photoshop document for each channel of each stack of the Substance 3D Painter document, preserving the stack hierarchy (layers and groups). Unfortunately, blending modes and filters are not fully compatible between Photoshop and Substance 3D Painter, hence the final result can be different between the two softwares.

## Installation

Download or clone this project into the Substance 3D Painter plugins folder. The plugins folder can be opened from Substance 3D Painter through the menu ``Plugins/Plugins folder``. Substance 3D Painter needs to be restarted for the plugin to take effect.
